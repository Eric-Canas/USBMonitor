# USBMonitor
<img alt="USBMonitor" title="USBMonitor" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eric-Canas/USBMonitor/main/resources/logo.png" width="20%" align="left"> **USBMonitor** is a versatile **cross-platform** library that simplifies **USB device monitoring** for _Windows_, _Linux_ and _MacOS_ systems. It enables developers to effortlessly track device **connections**, **disconnections**, and access to all connected device **attributes**.

With **USBMonitor**, developers can stay up-to-date with any changes in the connected USB devices, allowing them to **trigger specific actions** whenever a USB device is connected or disconnected. By ensuring **consistent functionality across various operating systems**, **USBMonitor** removes the need to address platform-specific quirks, inconsistencies, or incompatibilities, resulting in a smooth and efficient USB device management experience. The uniformity in functionality significantly enhances **code compatibility**, minimizing the risk of **code issues** or **unexpected breaks** when moving between platforms.

At its core, **USBMonitor** utilizes <a href="https://pyudev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">pyudev</a> (for Linux environments), <a href="https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32" target="_blank">WMI</a> (for Windows environments), and the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/IOKitFundamentals/TheRegistry/TheRegistry.html" target="_blank"> I/O Registry</a> (for MacOs environments). Handling all the low-level intricacies and translating OS-specific information to ensure consistency across all systems.

## Installation
To install **USBMonitor**, simply run:

```bash
pip install usb-monitor
```

## Usage
Using **USBMonitor** is both simple and straight-forward. In most cases, you'll just want to start the [monitoring _Daemon_](#usbmonitorstart_monitoringon_connect--none-on_disconnect--none-check_every_seconds--05), defining the `on_connect` and `on_disconnect` callback functions to manage events when a USB device connects or disconnects. Here's a basic example:

```python
from usbmonitor import USBMonitor
from usbmonitor.attributes import ID_MODEL, ID_MODEL_ID, ID_VENDOR_ID

device_info_str = lambda device_info: f"{device_info[ID_MODEL]} ({device_info[ID_MODEL_ID]} - {device_info[ID_VENDOR_ID]})"
# Define the `on_connect` and `on_disconnect` callbacks
on_connect = lambda device_id, device_info: print(f"Connected: {device_info_str(device_info=device_info)}")
on_disconnect = lambda device_id, device_info: print(f"Disconnected: {device_info_str(device_info=device_info)}")

# Create the USBMonitor instance
monitor = USBMonitor()

# Start the daemon
monitor.start_monitoring(on_connect=on_connect, on_disconnect=on_disconnect)

# ... Rest of your code ...

# If you don't need it anymore stop the daemon
monitor.stop_monitoring()
```

Sometimes, when initializing your software, you may seek to confirm which USB devices are indeed connected.

```python
from usbmonitor import USBMonitor
from usbmonitor.attributes import ID_MODEL, ID_MODEL_ID, ID_VENDOR_ID

# Create the USBMonitor instance
monitor = USBMonitor()

# Get the current devices
devices_dict = monitor.get_available_devices()

# Print them
for device_id, device_info in devices_dict.items():
    print(f"{device_id} -- {device_info[ID_MODEL]} ({device_info[ID_MODEL_ID]} - {device_info[ID_VENDOR_ID]})")
```
Output
```bash
/dev/bus/usb/001/001 -- xHCI_Host_Controller (0002 - 1d6b)
/dev/bus/usb/001/002 -- USB2.0_Hub (3431 - 2109)
/dev/bus/usb/001/003 -- USB_Optical_Mouse (c077 - 046d)
/dev/bus/usb/001/004 -- USB_Compliant_Keypad (9881 - 05a4)
/dev/bus/usb/002/001 -- xHCI_Host_Controller (0003 - 1d6b)
```



## API Reference

### USBMonitor(filter_devices = None)

Initialize the USBMonitor instance. It will allow to inspect and monitor connected devices

- `filter_devices`: **tuple[dict[str, str]] | None**. A tuple of dictionaries containing the device attributes to filter. If passed, it will only return and monitor devices that match any of the specified filters. For example, if you want to only retrieve and track devices with 'ID_VENDOR_FROM_DATABASE' = 'Realtek' or the device with 'ID_VENDOR_ID' = '1234' and 'ID_MODEL_ID' = '1A2B' you should instantiate with: `USBMonitor(filter_devices=({'ID_VENDOR_FROM_DATABASE': 'Realtek'}, {'ID_VENDOR_ID': '1234', 'ID_MODEL_ID': '1A2B'}))`. Default value is None.

### USBMonitor.start_monitoring(on_connect = None, on_disconnect = None, check_every_seconds = 0.5)
Starts a daemon that continuously monitors the connected USB devices in order to detect new connections or disconnections. When a device is disconnected, the `on_disconnect` callback function is invoked with the Device ID as the first argument and the [dictionary of device information](#device-properties) as the second argument. Similarly, when a new device is connected, the `on_connect` callback function is called with the same arguments. This allows developers to promptly respond to any changes in the connected USB devices and perform necessary actions.

- `on_connect`: **callable | None**. The function to call every time a device is **added**. It is expected to have the following format `on_connect(device_id: str, device_info: dict[str, dict[str, str|tuple[str, ...]]])`
- `on_disconnect`: **callable | None**. The function to call every time a device is **removed**. It is expected to have the following format `on_disconnect(device_id: str, device_info: dict[str, dict[str, str|tuple[str, ...]]])`
- `check_every_seconds`: **int | float**. Seconds to wait between each check for changes in the USB devices. Default value is 0.5 seconds.

### USBMonitor.stop_monitoring(warn_if_was_stopped=True)
Stops the monitoring of USB devices. This function will **stop** the daemon launched by `USBMonitor.start_monitoring`

- `warn_if_was_stopped`: **bool**. If set to `True`, this function will issue a warning if the monitoring of USB devices was already stopped (the daemon was not running).


### USBMonitor.get_available_devices()
Returns a dictionary of the currently available devices, where the key is the `Device ID` and the value is a [dictionary containing the device's information](#device-properties). All the keys of this dictionary can be found at `attributes.DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES`. They always correspond with the default Linux device properties (independently of the OS where the library is running).

- Returns: **dict[str, dict[str, str|tuple[str, ...]]]**: A dictionary containing the currently available devices. All values are strings except for `ID_USB_INTERFACES`, which is a `tuple` of `string`



### USBMonitor.changes_from_last_check(update_last_check_devices = True)
Returns a tuple of two dictionaries, one containing the devices that have been *removed* since the last check, and another one containing the devices that have been *added*. Both dictionaries will have the `Device ID` as key and all the device information as value. Remember that all the [keys of this dictionary](#device-properties) can be found at can be found at `attributes.DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES`.

- `update_last_check_devices`: **bool**. If `True` it will update the internal `USBMonitor.last_check_devices` attribute. So the next time you'll call this method, it will check for differences against the devices found in that current call. If `False` it won't update the `USBMonitor.last_check_devices` attribute. 

- Returns: **tuple[dict[str, dict[str, str|tuple[str, ...]]], dict[str, dict[str, str|tuple[str, ...]]]]**: A `tuple` containing two `dictionaries`. The first `dictionary` contains the information of the devices that were **removed** since the last check and the second dictionary contains the information of the new **added** devices. All values are `strings` except for `ID_USB_INTERFACES`, which is a `tuple` of `string`.

### USBMonitor.check_changes(on_connect = None, on_disconnect = None, update_last_check_devices = True)
Checks for any new connections or disconnections of USB devices since the last check. If a device has been removed, the `on_disconnect` function will be called with the `Device ID` as the first argument and the [dictionary with the device's information](#device-properties) as the second argument. The same will occur with the `on_connect` function if any new device have been added. Internally this function will just run `USBMonitor.changes_from_last_check` and will execute the callbacks for each returned device

- `on_connect`: **callable | None**. The function to call when a device is added. It is expected to have the following format `on_connect(device_id: str, device_info: dict[str, dict[str, str|tuple[str, ...]]])`
- `on_disconnect`: **callable | None**. The function to call when a device is removed. It is expected to have the following format `on_disconnect(device_id: str, device_info: dict[str, dict[str, str|tuple[str, ...]]])`
- `update_last_check_devices`: **bool**. If `True` it will update the internal `USBMonitor.last_check_devices` attribute. So the next time you'll call this method, it will check for differences against the devices found in that current call. If `False` it won't update the `USBMonitor.last_check_devices` attribute. 

### Device Properties

The `device_info` returned by most functions will contain the following information:

Key | Value Description | Example
:-- | :-- | :--
`'ID_MODEL_ID'` | The product ID of the USB device. | `'0892'`
`'ID_MODEL'` | The name of the USB device model. | `'HD_Pro_Webcam_C920'`
`'ID_MODEL_FROM_DATABASE'` | Device model name, retrieved from the device database.| `'OrbiCam'`
`'ID_VENDOR'` | The name of the USB device vendor | `'046d'`
`'ID_VENDOR_ID'` | The vendor ID of the USB device. | `'046d'`
`'ID_VENDOR_FROM_DATABASE'` | USB device vendor's name, from the device database. | `'Logitech, Inc.'`
`'ID_USB_INTERFACES'` |	A `tuple` representing the USB device's interfaces. | `('0e0100', '0e0200', '010100', '010200')`
`'DEVNAME'` | The device name or path  | `'/dev/bus/usb/001/003'`
`'DEVTYPE'` | Should always be `'usb_device'`. | `'usb_device'`

Note that, depending on the device and the OS, some of this information may be incomplete or certain attributes may overlap with others.
